        <h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>
        My name is Hauwa Poloma-Obadan, I'm a student at AltSchool Africa Class
        of Tinyuka. I currently live in Makurdi, Benue State in Nigeria. I am self employed as a Relocation consultant. I am also a military spouse.<br /> <br>
        My intention for joining this cohort is to learn to code in a intensive
        and emersive way, which will enable me become a world class backend
        developer. <br /> <br>
        My journey so far 
    has been full of ups and downs and I do hope to
        succeed and celebrate in September 2024 as I
        graduate from AltSchool Africa as a certfied developer with not only
        knowledge but also the mindset and skills to help me excel in the world.
